# 事件系统

react16 与 17 事件区别

![](https://reactjs.org/static/bb4b10114882a50090b8ff61b3c4d0fd/21cdd/react_17_delegation.png)

react16和17在委托事件的容器上做出了改变，react16的事件会冒泡的document上，而17则会冒泡到root容器上，也就是ReactDom.render的第二个参数.

调用批量更新

```jsx
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
```

**Setting state only changes it for the next render**

Here is what this button’s click handler tells React to do:

1. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).
2. 
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.

2. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).

React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.

3. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).

React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.

Even though you called setNumber(number + 1) three times, in this render’s event handler number is always 0, so you set the state to 1 three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with number equal to 1 rather than 3.

**React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.**

This is why the re-render only happens after all these setNumber() calls.


```jsx
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
```

1. setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.

2. setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.

3. setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.


```jsx
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(42);
      }}>Increase the number</button>
```

To summarize, here’s how you can think of what you’re passing to the setNumber state setter:

An updater function (e.g. n => n + 1) gets added to the queue.
Any other value (e.g. number 5) adds “replace with 5” to the queue, ignoring what’s already queued.

After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so updater functions must be pure and only return the result. Don’t try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.
